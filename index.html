            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm a rising junior at MIT majoring in Course 6-3 (Computer Science and Engineering). Although I go to school in Massachusetts,
              I'm originally from La Vista, NE — a suburb right of Omaha. I lived in La Vista for my entire life before college, and I spend my 
              school breaks there.<br><br>

              Right now, I'm working as a software engineering intern in Omaha. I'm interested in becoming a software engineer after college, 
              although I'm also open to other fields related to Computer Science. Previously, I had a data science research position 
              through my school on a project involving climate change data. <br><br>
            
              Most of my programming experience is in Python, which is what most of my coursework in college has been taught in so far.
              Additionally, I used Python for data science in my freshman year research, using libraries such as Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas.
              Besides Python, I'm self-taught in HTML and CSS, and I'm proficient in TypeScript, which I used in a Software construction class.
              I'm currently gaining more experience with .NET, C#, and the Angular framework in my current internship.<br><br>

              Outside of school, I enjoy playing video games. Some of my favorite include League of Legends, Valorant, Smash Bros, and Minecraft.
              Other things I do in my free time include solving crossword puzzles, doing Sporcle quizzes, reading, and building legos. I've also been trying to 
              read more over this past summer.
